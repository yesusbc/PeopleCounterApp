## What it Does

The people counter application will demonstrate how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. The app will detect people in a designated area, providing the number of people in the frame, average duration of people in frame, and total count.

## How it Works

The counter will use the Inference Engine included in the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ Toolkit. The model used should be able to identify people in a video frame. The app should count the number of people in the current frame, the duration that a person is in the frame (time elapsed between entering and exiting a frame) and the total count of people. It then sends the data to a local web server using the Paho MQTT Python package.

You will choose a model to use and convert it with the Model Optimizer.

## Requirements

### Hardware

* 6th to 10th generation Intel® Core™ processor with Iris® Pro graphics or Intel® HD Graphics.
* OR use of Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2)

### Software

*   Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit 2019 R3 release
*   Node v6.17.1
*   Npm v3.10.10
*   CMake
*   MQTT Mosca server
  
        
## Setup

### Install Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit
https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/index.html

### Add a Person Detection Model
You could download any model of your selection and then convert it to an OpenVino Intermediate Representation
Follow this link for extra information
https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_prepare_model_convert_model_Converting_Model.html

Or you can use any of the already pretained models offered by Intel. As a recommendation I used:
https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_models_intel_person_detection_retail_0013_description_person_detection_retail_0013.html
 ```
wget "model-url
tar -xvf “folder”.tar.gz
 ```

### Install Nodejs and its dependencies

Utilize the classroom workspace, or refer to the relevant instructions for your operating system for this step.

- [Linux/Ubuntu](./linux-setup.md)
- [Mac](./mac-setup.md)
- [Windows](./windows-setup.md)

### Install npm

There are three components that need to be running in separate terminals for this application to work:

-   MQTT Mosca server 
-   Node.js* Web server
-   FFmpeg server
     
From the main directory:

* For MQTT/Mosca server:
   ```
   cd webservice/server
   npm install
   ```

* For Web server:
  ```
  cd ../ui
  npm install
  ```
  **Note:** If any configuration errors occur in mosca server or Web server while using **npm install**, use the below commands:
   ```
   sudo npm install npm -g 
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm cache clean
   npm config set registry "http://registry.npmjs.org"
   npm install
   ```

## Run the application

From the main directory:

### Step 1 - Start the Mosca server

```
cd webservice/server/node-server
node ./server.js
```

You should see the following message, if successful:
```
Mosca server started.
```

### Step 2 - Start the GUI

Open new terminal and run below commands.
```
cd webservice/ui
npm run dev
```

You should see the following message in the terminal.
```
webpack: Compiled successfully
```

### Step 3 - FFmpeg Server

Open new terminal and run the below commands.
```
sudo ffserver -f ./ffmpeg/server.conf
```

### Step 4 - Run the code

Open a new terminal to run the code. 

#### Setup the environment

You must configure the environment to use the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit one time per session by running the following command:
```
source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh -pyver 3.5
```

You should also be able to run the application with Python 3.6, although newer versions of Python will not work with the app.

#### Running on the CPU

When running Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit Python applications on the CPU, the CPU extension library is required. This can be found at: 

```
/opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/
```

*Depending on whether you are using Linux or Mac, the filename will be either `libcpu_extension_sse4.so` or `libcpu_extension.dylib`, respectively.* (The Linux filename may be different if you are using a AVX architecture)

Though by default application runs on CPU, this can also be explicitly specified by ```-d CPU``` command-line argument:

##### On Video
```
python main.py -i resources/Pedestrian_Detect_2_1_1.mp4 -m model/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d CPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```

##### On Image
```
python main.py -i images/people-counter-image.png -m model/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d CPU -pt 0.6
```

##### On Webcam
```
python main.py -i CAM -m model/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d CPU -pt 0.6 | ffmpeg -v warning -f rawvideo -pixel_format bgr24 -video_size 768x432 -framerate 24 -i - http://0.0.0.0:3004/fac.ffm
```
